## About

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Java. This project follows the **The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need** course from [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms) by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/theprimeagen). 

Each implemented algorithm and data structure has its own set of test cases to verify its expected behavior.
